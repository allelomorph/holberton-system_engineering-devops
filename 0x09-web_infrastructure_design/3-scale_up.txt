3. Scale up

You must add:
    1 server
    1 load-balancer (HAproxy) configured as cluster with the other one
    Split components (web server, application server, database) with their own server

You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:

    For every additional element, why you are adding it
    	-- 1 server: a new total of 4 hardware hosts allows for redistribution of server software.
    	-- 1 load-balancer (HAproxy) configured as cluster with the other one: load balancing can be set to active/passive, with second LB as failover redundancy.
    	-- Split components (web server, application server, database) with their own server: With only 4 servers to allocate, chose to make the web server the one with redundancy to handle more simultaneous requests.
